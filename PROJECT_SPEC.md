# Research Engineering Practices

## Vision
Curated guide to engineering practices for research teams, bridging research and product engineering.

## Core Questions
- How does research engineering differ from product engineering?
- What rituals work for research teams?
- How should teams and sub-teams interact?
- What's the minimum viable engineering for reproducibility?

## Key Topics

### Minimum Viable Engineering
- **Schemas** - validate data at boundaries
- **Unit tests** - test core logic, not notebooks
- **Type hints** - document intent
- **Version control** - git from day 1

### Team Rituals
- Code review (async, not blocking)
- Weekly demos (show, don't tell)
- Retrospectives (monthly)
- Documentation sprints

### Team Structures
- Research pods (2-4 people, focused)
- Cross-functional pairing (engineer + scientist)
- Office hours (share expertise)
- Rotating "engineering champion"

### Research vs Product
| Aspect | Research | Product |
|--------|----------|---------|
| Iteration | Exploratory | Incremental |
| Testing | Reproducibility | Coverage |
| Docs | Papers | User-facing |
| Debt | Acceptable | Managed |
| Scope | Unknown | Defined |

## Literature Sources to Find
- Google Research practices
- Meta FAIR engineering
- DeepMind workflows
- Academic software engineering papers
- Research software engineering (RSE) community
- Carpentries lessons

## Deliverables
- Curated reading list
- Practice recommendations
- Team checklist
- Ritual templates

## Python Guidance
- Not a library → modern Python (3.10+) is fine
- Don't worry about wide version windows
- Focus on reusability and modularity
